# 100% API compatibility target and required app corpus

The completion target is **100% of the Windows API surface and working execution of all five required applications**. This is an aspiration, not a current result. A count of exported names or successful imports is only a preliminary metric: an API counts as compatible only after its documented behavior is tested in the Windows 98 guest. A stub that always succeeds or always fails does not count unless that result is the correct contract for the guest state.

## Fixed reference surface

Use the Microsoft Windows SDK **10.0.28000.2705** (released August 2026) as the initial frozen reference. Its Win32 and WinRT desktop API declarations form the inventory to classify; this includes interface methods as well as DLL exports. The locally installed 10.0.26100.0 SDK can bootstrap the inventory, but a percentage calculated against that older subset must be labeled with its version and must not be called full 28000 coverage. Driver DDIs, .NET APIs, and the independently shipped Windows App SDK are recorded separately because the original project excludes modern application drivers and those interfaces are not all Windows SDK OS APIs. [Windows SDK overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-sdk/), [SDK release notes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-sdk/release-notes), [desktop API families](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/api-reference/).

The inventory must record stable API identity, architecture, minimum OS, interface/contract version, and feature dependencies. A numerator entry requires a guest test for success, failure, memory ownership, thread behavior, and documented edge cases as appropriate. For a native Windows 98 function, this means a guest test of the original API. For a wrapper, this means the same test through KernelEx. No complete denominator or 100% score has been computed yet.

## User-selected application corpus

These programs are separate integration probes. Their static PE import coverage and their actual startup/function tests are reported separately from the full-SDK percentage. Versions below are pinned as of 2026-09-23 where the publisher offered a current release.

All five archives were downloaded into ignored `benchmarks/media/`; the Chromium snapshot matched its Google Storage MD5 metadata, while Supermium, VLC, and Notepad++ matched hashes published on their release/download pages. The VS Code hash above is a local digest of the official HTTPS download, not a separately published publisher checksum. The four x86 entry points have PE machine `0x014C`; VS Code 1.138.0 has `0x8664` (x64).

For each binary, record direct and delay-load imports, dependent DLLs, loader failure, and a reproducible guest test. Import coverage is a triage metric, not the 100% full-API goal and not evidence that the application runs. Each required app needs a separate guest launch and meaningful functionality result before completion is claimed.

## Latest 0.1.8 COMCTL32 candidate: Notepad++ 8.9.8

This checkpoint is newer than the provider19 and USER32 loader results below.
The PNG-capable `M98CTLP.DLL` was installed as the versioned KernelEx provider
`M98CTL3.DLL` (SHA-256
`aafd97b71ff63c9f9cedffa4705713243d5708f22ff6ffaf04c732261ca0e3f8`);
after a hardware-accelerated cold boot, a genuine static
`COMCTL32` ordinal 345/381 import probe returned exit 0. Separate direct
guest probes passed generated PNG icon groups at requested sizes 16, 32, 40
and 48, the pinned app's PNG-backed icon group 501 at 16 pixels, and the
same-size 16-bpp source choice on a four-bit display.
The exact binary and direct/static evidence are documented in
`docs/COMCTL_ORDINAL_PORT.md` and `docs/RELEASE_0_1_8_CHECKPOINT.md`.

With this candidate, the pinned x86 Notepad++ 8.9.8 executable moved past its
previous `WM_CREATE` access violation and icon 501 warning. A bounded
`APP_PROBE.EXE` guest run saw the editor window by 3.974 seconds and a
visible editor still present at 12.004 seconds. The tool then posted
`WM_CLOSE` and ultimately terminated the process. A close operation
displayed a Windows 98 invalid-page-fault dialog. This is a startup
milestone, **not** a clean shutdown or complete application pass.

With the same `M98CTL3.DLL`, an existing 13-byte text file was opened, edited,
and saved with `Ctrl+S`. The guest remote tester read back 34 bytes with
SHA-256 `a1853e54f7e131411c6f0787e80d8f7157f3e60ce85438ddfc427c5b82bf1c2c`;
the exact ASCII text was `Saved under M98CTL3\r\nBaseline v3\r\n`.
This is one verified existing-file save, not general Save As or clean exit.

Save As for a **new** document did not show a dialog or write a verified new
file. A read-only guest diagnostic found the Vista `CLSID_FileSaveDialog` registry entries
absent and `CoCreateInstance` for its `IFileDialog` interface returned
`0x80040154` (`REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG`), while a Shell Link COM control passed.
The pinned Notepad++ source calls that interface on the new-document save
path; see `docs/NPP_SAVE_DIALOG_TRIAGE.md`. The successful existing-file save
does not exercise that new-document dialog path. No full Notepad++ success is
claimed. The other four required apps have not gained a new functional pass
from this COMCTL32 work; their last guest results remain the historical
provider19 checkpoint below.

## Historical Notepad++ 8.9.8 guest probes

The previous KERNEL32-only checkpoint cold-booted the installed Win98 SE guest with
`M98WRP19.DLL` (89 KERNEL32 table names), SHA-256
`ee96a7d5dfda768f21eb0098b8dafdd4080a018847329e5e145d8086b7a46cd4`.
Six static-import suites passed: InitOnce (4 APIs), threadpool work (5),
threadpool callback extensions (7), SList (7), NLS (2), and FLS/lifecycle (13).
These are **38 focused API contract subsets**, not 38 fully compatible APIs.
The ten-test lifecycle regression bundle also passed the 89-name table smoke,
FLS concurrency/termination tests, and EXE plus system MSVCRT thread-exit
callbacks. Exact source/provider/test hashes are in
`benchmarks/api-guest-evidence-v1.json` and family documents.

At that checkpoint, APP_PROBE returned exit 2 and `LAUNCH_FAIL win32_error=31`;
the dialog named `USER32.RemoveClipboardFormatListener`
(`build/guest/npp-after-fls19.png`). The previous FlsAlloc import had been passed.

The next guest checkpoint installed `M98USR1.DLL` (SHA-256
`4932584fcb7f1af493dbebfd76a38ede4f04b5543a0559cdd8fd1c33ff8b3fc7`)
and CORE.INI with nine USER32 routes (SHA-256
`2e853bcdd3a686ad8d105ee47219049efcdd9fbcfeddeac29c9d061eadd0bcc9`).
After a clean hardware-accelerated cold boot, the six-test clipboard suite
passed, including full static imports, owned data round trips, six queued
change notifications and restoration of the empty clipboard. Exact receipt:
`build/guest/suite-clipboard-user1.json`; contract and limits:
`docs/CLIPBOARD_CONTRACT_TESTS.md`.

At that historical checkpoint, Notepad++ did not start. Its next loader dialog named
`GDI32.DLL!GdiAlphaBlend`; APP_PROBE returned exit 2 / Win32 error 31.
`benchmarks/npp-clipboard-user1.json` records the screenshot and tested
provider hashes. This advanced the loader dependency but proved no editing
function. The other required application results below remain from the earlier
provider19 checkpoint; no app gained a functionality pass then.

Earlier provider16 stopped at `InitializeSListHead`. A preceding warm restart
of a combined change produced one VxD exception preserved in a separate
snapshot. Later normal shutdown/cold boots passed; repeated warm-restart
reliability remains unverified. During provider17 testing an early host pipe
request before the guest remote agent was ready required transport recovery
and another normal guest shutdown. This is not an API test pass or failure.

The first x86 portable build attempt in the Windows 98 SE + KernelEx guest stopped at a missing `DBGHELP.DLL` loader dialog (`vm/npp-first-run.png`). Its direct `DBGHELP.DLL` import is `ImageNtHeader`. The OEM Windows 98 `IMAGEHLP.DLL` already exports that function (see `benchmarks/win98se-ko-oem-native-exports-v1.json`), so `build/dbghelp.dll` provides the same export and calls the installed native implementation. This bridge passes a PE32 Windows 98 import gate and a 32-bit Windows host smoke test, including a malformed PE image returning `NULL`.

In the earlier loader sequence, with the bridge beside `notepad++.exe`, the next guest loader dialog reported missing `DWMAPI.DLL` (`vm/npp-shim-result.png`). An app-local DLL exports the two directly imported DWM functions and reports disabled composition. After initial shims the guest showed a generic invalid-format error (`vm/npp-new-alert-upper.png`); changing the executable's PE version fields in an **ignored local test copy** did not help (`vm/npp-pe410-error-revealed.png`). A clean retry with app-local BCRYPT exposed the specific issue: `DWMAPI.DLL` had no base relocation directory, so Win98 could not load it after another shim occupied the preferred base (`vm/npp-after-bcrypt.png`). The DWM build now forces a real base relocation; its PE gate, host smoke, and Win98 guest direct smoke pass (`vm/dwm-reloc-guest-smoke.png`).

The seven direct BCRYPT imports are provided by an app-local SHA-256/MD5/HMAC subset. Its PE gate, host known-answer tests, and Win98 guest direct smoke pass (`vm/bcrypt-guest-smoke.png`). MD5/SHA256 and HMAC pseudo-handle paths also passed a direct guest smoke (`vm/pseudo-guest-smoke.png`). With DBGHELP, relocatable DWMAPI, and BCRYPT present, Notepad++ next stopped at the absent `SHCreateItemFromParsingName` export in native `SHELL32.DLL` (`vm/npp-after-dwm-reloc.png`). A new KernelEx Shell API library now supplies `SHCreateItemFromParsingName`, `SHParseDisplayName`, and the focused file-system case of `SHOpenFolderAndSelectItems`; direct and static-import guest probes passed, and Explorer selected the test file (`vm/select-shell3-guest.png`). At that historical stage, the following Notepad++ loader error was `UXTHEME.DLL!DrawThemeTextEx` (`vm/npp-after-uxtheme.png`). A no-theme bridge passed direct guest testing, but KernelEx's KnownDLL redirection bypassed an app-local `UXTHEME.DLL`, so the app had **not** started then. None of the publisher binaries or test ISOs is distributed by this project.

## Historical provider19 five-application checkpoint

Exact executable hashes, PE architectures and receipts are recorded in
`benchmarks/app-guest-checkpoint-provider19.json`. App media remain ignored.

| Selected application | Result at provider19 checkpoint | Next shared prerequisite then |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chromium 150 x86 | Loader error 31; CHROME_ELF.DLL requires KERNEL32.AddVectoredExceptionHandler | Exception dispatch and vectored-handler family |
| Supermium 144 R5 x86 | After selecting its version directory as cwd, loader error 31; P_NTD.DLL requires NTDLL.LdrGetProcedureAddress | NT loader/export-resolution backend and bundled wrapper dependency closure |
| VLC 3.0.24 x86 | Process launches but only a failure dialog appears: invalid options or no plugins found. Same result with application directory as cwd. No player UI or playback | Plugin discovery/loading and full dependent API contracts |
| Notepad++ 8.9.8 x86 | Loader error 31 at GDI32.GdiAlphaBlend after USER32 clipboard routes | GDI alpha drawing family and graphics backend |
| VSCode 1.138.0 x64 | Local PE32+ AMD64 inspection; not launched in x86 Win98 | x64 execution plus user API/loader architecture path |

VLC's APP_PROBE exit 0 means the observation tool completed and closed the
observed process. Its screenshot shows an error dialog, so it is explicitly
not an application success. Supermium's first root-cwd attempt could not find
CHROME_ELF.DLL; using the packaged version directory resolved that layout issue
and exposed the NT loader prerequisite. This does not establish installation
or application compatibility. No target version was replaced by an older one.
